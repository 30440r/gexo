# Gexo (previously ~~Fugu~~15) - ????-tethered iOS 15 Jailbreak.

Gexo is an (most definitely incomplete) iOS 15 Jailbreak, using bind mounts (thanks siguza) or being rootless.
The CVE numbers of the vulnerabilities I used are: CVE-2021-30883 & CVE-2021-30955

# Supported Devices/iOS Versions

Gexo *should* support all arm64e devices (iPhone XS and newer) on iOS 15, 15.0.1, ~~15.0.2~~, & 15.1 Beta 1, 2, 3, 15.1 Final & 15.1.1 (A14-A15).

arm64 devices are not supported because the exploit does not work on these devices.  
However, it is possible to jailbreak arm64 devices with [checkra1n](https://checkra.in){:target="_blank"} (it works on every iOS other than ~~14.8.1~~ & 15.x.)
